    "## 1. What is V2X Communication?\n",
    "\n",
    "**V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything)** allows vehicles to communicate with:\n",
    "- **V2V**: Other vehicles\n",
    "- **V2I**: Infrastructure (traffic lights, road signs)\n",
    "- **V2P**: Pedestrians (smartphones)\n",
    "- **V2N**: Network (cloud services)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why V2X Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous vehicles have physical limitations:\n",
    "- **Line-of-sight**: Cannot see around corners or through obstacles\n",
    "- **Sensor range**: LiDAR effective to ~200m, radar ~250m\n",
    "- **Occlusions**: Trucks, buildings block view\n",
    "- **Weather**: Fog, rain reduce visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**V2X solves this** by sharing information wirelessly:\n",
    "- Vehicle behind truck sees what's ahead via V2V\n",
    "- Traffic light tells approaching vehicle it will turn red in 5 seconds\n",
    "- Emergency vehicle broadcasts its location before it's visible\n",
    "- Pedestrian's phone warns vehicle of crossing intent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies show V2X can prevent:\n",
    "- **80% of intersection crashes** (through V2I traffic light warnings)\n",
    "- **70% of rear-end collisions** (through V2V emergency braking alerts)\n",
    "- **50% of pedestrian accidents** (through V2P warnings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** V2X is complementary to sensors, not a replacement."

    "- Based on IEEE 802.11p (WiFi variant)\n",

    "- **Status**: Being phased out in US and EU\n",
    "\n",
    "### C-V2X (Cellular V2X)\n",
    "- Based on 3GPP standards (4G LTE, 5G NR)\n",
    "- Operating frequency: 5.9 GHz (same as DSRC)\n",
    "- Range: ~1000m (5G)\n",

    "## 3. Cooperative Perception\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cooperative Perception** = Vehicles share what they \"see\" with each other\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vehicle A** detects object with camera/LiDAR\n",
    "2. **Vehicle A** broadcasts object data via V2V:\n",
    "   - Object type (car, pedestrian, cyclist)\n",
    "   - Position (GPS coordinates)\n",
    "   - Velocity vector\n",
    "   - Timestamp\n",
    "3. **Vehicle B** (behind truck, cannot see object) receives message\n",
    "4. **Vehicle B** incorporates object into its world model\n",
    "5. **Vehicle B** can now plan around invisible object\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **See through occlusions**: Know what's behind trucks, buildings\n",
    "- **Extended range**: Perception beyond sensor limits\n",
    "- **Redundancy**: Cross-validate own detections with others\n",
    "- **Early warnings**: React to hazards before they're visible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coordinate systems**: Must align different vehicle reference frames\n",
    "- **Time synchronization**: GPS time accurate to ~10ns needed\n",
    "- **Data association**: Which message corresponds to which object?\n",
    "- **Trust**: How to handle false or malicious messages?\n",
    "- **Bandwidth**: Limited spectrum, cannot share everything"

    "- DSRC vs C-V2X debate delayed deployment by 10 years\n",
    "- Early DSRC investments wasted as industry shifts to C-V2X\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 4: Interoperability\n",
    "- Different standards in US, EU, China\n",
    "- Cross-border vehicles need multiple radios\n",
