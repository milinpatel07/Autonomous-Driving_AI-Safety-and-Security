## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find an error, broken link, outdated information, or have a suggestion:

1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/milinpatel07/Autonomous-Driving_AI-Safety-and-Security/issues)
2. Use a clear, descriptive title
3. Describe the problem and where you found it (module, notebook, cell number)
4. If applicable, suggest a fix or improvement

### Suggesting Improvements

Ideas for new content, better explanations, or structural changes are welcome. Open an issue with the label `enhancement` and describe:

- What you would like to see added or changed
- Why it would improve the resource
- Any references or materials that support the suggestion

### Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `master`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Test any modified notebooks to ensure they run without errors
5. Commit with a clear message describing what you changed and why

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep changes focused — one topic per pull request
- Follow the existing file naming conventions (`##_descriptive_name.ipynb`)
- Ensure notebooks run cleanly in Google Colab
- Include copyright and author information consistent with existing notebooks
- Reference relevant standards (ISO 26262, ISO 21448, ISO/SAE 21434, ISO/PAS 8800) where applicable

## Content Guidelines

- **Accuracy**: Ensure technical content is correct and references appropriate standards
- **Clarity**: Write for a reader who may be new to the topic — explain terminology and assumptions
- **Conciseness**: Be thorough but avoid unnecessary repetition
- **Code quality**: Include comments, use descriptive variable names, and handle common errors
- **Visualizations**: Prefer clear, labeled plots with titles and axis labels
