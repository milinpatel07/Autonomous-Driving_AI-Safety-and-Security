# ⚠️ MODULE DEPRECATED - CONTENT MERGED INTO MODULE 01

## This Module Has Been Reorganized

The datasets and benchmarking content has been **integrated into Module 01 (Perception Systems)** where it logically belongs.

### Why the Change?

Datasets are used to **train and evaluate perception systems**. Separating them from perception algorithms made the learning flow disjointed.

It's more natural to:
1. Learn perception algorithms
2. Apply them to industry datasets
3. Evaluate using standard benchmarks

...all in one integrated module.

### Where to Find Datasets Content Now:

**Go to: [Module 01 - Perception Systems](../01_Perception_Systems/)**

Specifically:
- **[01_Perception_Systems/notebooks/07_dataset_overview.ipynb](../01_Perception_Systems/notebooks/07_dataset_overview.ipynb)**

This notebook covers:
- KITTI 3D Object Detection benchmark
- nuScenes multi-modal dataset
- Waymo Open Dataset
- Dataset comparison and selection
- Evaluation metrics (AP, mAP, IoU, NDS)
- Working with dataset devkits

### Related Content in Module 01:

The full perception module now includes:
- Object detection algorithms (what to run on datasets)
- Sensor fusion (multi-modal data handling)
- LiDAR processing (for 3D datasets)
- **Datasets and evaluation** (this module's content)

## Note on Original Structure

The original Module 10 README claimed **4 notebooks** would be available. In reality, only **1 notebook** was ever created.

This reorganization is part of making the repository **honest and accurate** about what content actually exists.
