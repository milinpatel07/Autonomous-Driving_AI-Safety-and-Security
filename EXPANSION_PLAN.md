# Repository Expansion Plan - Session 5

**Author:** Milin Patel
**Date:** 2025-11-23

## What's Being Added

Adding **Session 5: Advanced Topics** with 6 new notebooks covering critical gaps:

### New Notebooks

1. **Notebook 19: V2X Communication and Cooperative Perception** ✅ CREATED
   - V2V, V2I, V2P, V2N communication
   - C-V2X vs DSRC comparison
   - Cooperative perception (seeing beyond line-of-sight)
   - V2X security threats and ISO/SAE 21434 application
   - Real-world deployment status

2. **Notebook 20: Explainability (XAI) for Safety Certification** - IN PROGRESS
   - Why XAI is mandatory for certification
   - XAI methods: LIME, SHAP, GradCAM, attention maps
   - Saliency maps for perception models
   - Counterfactual explanations
   - ISO/IEC TR 5469 XAI requirements
   - How to document AI decisions for regulators

3. **Notebook 21: Standards Integration - Practical Workflow** - PLANNED
   - How ISO 26262 + ISO 21448 + ISO/SAE 21434 work together
   - Which standard applies when?
   - Conflict resolution
   - Combined HARA + SOTIF + TARA analysis
   - Real example: AEB system full compliance

4. **Notebook 22: Industry Deployment Challenges** - PLANNED
   - Why Level 4/5 not deployed widely
   - Regulatory barriers (US, EU, China)
   - Liability and insurance issues
   - Cost of validation (billions of miles)
   - Economic viability
   - What's actually working (Waymo, Baidu)

5. **Notebook 23: ODD Definition and Runtime Monitoring** - PLANNED
   - What is ODD (Operational Design Domain)?
   - How to define ODD boundaries (ISO 34503)
   - ODD attributes: weather, roads, speed, lighting
   - Runtime ODD monitoring
   - Graceful degradation when leaving ODD
   - Minimal Risk Condition (MRC)

6. **Notebook 24: Standards Gaps and Open Problems** - PLANNED
   - What ISO 26262 cannot handle for AI/ML
   - SOTIF limitations
   - Unresolved research questions
   - Emerging issues not yet standardized
   - Future standards in development
   - Areas needing more research

## Repository Name Suggestions

Current: `Autonomous-Driving_AI-Safety-and-Security`

Alternatives (more descriptive):
1. `AV-Safety-Engineering-Workshop` (shorter, clearer)
2. `ISO-Compliant-Autonomous-Vehicle-Safety` (emphasizes standards)
3. `Autonomous-Vehicle-Safety-Standards-Complete` (emphasizes completeness)

**Recommendation:** Keep current name, it's clear and established.

## Description Update

Current: "Comprehensive Workshop on AI-based Perception, Functional Safety, and Cybersecurity in Autonomous Vehicles"

Proposed: "Complete workshop on autonomous vehicle safety engineering: AI perception, ISO 26262/21448/21434 compliance, V2X communication, explainability, and deployment challenges"

## Total Content After Expansion

- **5 Sessions** (was 4)
