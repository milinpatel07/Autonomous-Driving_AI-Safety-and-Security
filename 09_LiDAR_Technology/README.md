# ⚠️ MODULE DEPRECATED - CONTENT MERGED INTO MODULE 01

## This Module Has Been Reorganized

The LiDAR technology content has been **integrated into Module 01 (Perception Systems)** where it logically belongs.

### Why the Change?

LiDAR is a **sensor technology** used for perception. Separating it from other sensors (cameras, radar) created artificial boundaries and made the repository harder to navigate.

Modern autonomous vehicles use **multi-modal sensor fusion** - cameras, LiDAR, and radar work together. It makes sense to learn about all sensors in one integrated module.

### Where to Find LiDAR Content Now:

**Go to: [Module 01 - Perception Systems](../01_Perception_Systems/)**

Specifically:
- **[01_Perception_Systems/notebooks/06_lidar_sensor_fundamentals.ipynb](../01_Perception_Systems/notebooks/06_lidar_sensor_fundamentals.ipynb)**

This notebook covers:
- LiDAR physics (time-of-flight, phase-shift)
- Scanning mechanisms (mechanical, solid-state, MEMS)
- Point cloud data structures
- Sensor specifications and commercial sensors
- 3D perception fundamentals

### Related Content in Module 01:

The full perception module now includes:
1. All sensor technologies (Camera, LiDAR, Radar)
2. Object detection algorithms
3. Sensor fusion (including LiDAR-Camera fusion)
4. 3D point cloud processing
5. Datasets with LiDAR data (KITTI, nuScenes, Waymo)

## Note on Original v2.0 Claims

The v2.0 README advertised **8 LiDAR notebooks** as "NEW". In reality, only **1 notebook** was ever created.

This reorganization is part of making the repository **honest and accurate** about what content actually exists.
